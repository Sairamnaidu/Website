<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>A friendly sun-Venus conjunction in outgoing Gemini on June 3 gives you the chance to add more important dates to your social calendar. New connections made now might only be temporary (due to Venus being retrograde), but they each serve a very specific and short-term beneficial purpose.

You’re tested during the sun-Mars square on the sixth, but it’s so satisfying to see the looks on your critics’ faces when you pass with flying colors. You might be down for a little while, but you always manage to spring back up eventually, and better than you were before, much to the disappointment of your haters.
A dreaded Mercury retrograde period starts on June 17, so be careful when doing DIY projects around the house. You have some excellent ideas about how to make changes without spending a lot of money, but cutting corners can lead to unforeseen complications.As a water sign, you need some kind of “container” to give your life shape. And with Jupiter in Capricorn sextile Neptune (February 20, July 27, and October 12), you’ll have opportunities to find one through participation in groups. Whether you’re brought together by politics, faith, or some other common interest, you’re encouraged to get out there and find your tribe.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Relationships get back on track and start moving forward again when Venus goes direct in easygoing Gemini on the twenty-fourth, but you might not be entirely out of the woods just yet. It’s easy to forgive but much harder to forget.

Powerful Mars enters your enthusiastic sign on June 27, so take full advantage of this forceful energy. When you grab the initiative, you show everyone that you aren’t afraid to take on new challenges.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>True, you’ve already got a family—and with Venus in Gemini (your fourth house) from April 3-August 7, you’ll be enjoying lots of quality time with them. Still, Pisces, the more time you spend with them, the easier it seems to lose touch with yourself. A square between Venus and Neptune (May 3, May 20, and July 27) challenges you to loosen the family ties a little and explore who you are outside the family dynamic.

Fortunately, Mars in your sign (May 12-June 27) gives you the confidence and courage to put yourself out there. You’re gaining a clearer sense of who you are—and just as importantly, who you aren’t. Boundary issues could resurface around the Mars/Neptune conjunction on June 13, but remember: If something feels “off” to you, you have every right to say no. And don’t be afraid to own that “no”—it’ll empower you to say a more decisive “yes” to what you do want!</strong></p>
