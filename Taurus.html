<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>With your ruler Venus in assertive Aries from February 7-March 4, it’s time to take matters into your own hands! Just be aware of any potential risks, and be sure it’s really your heart’s desire before going all in. Venus comes home to your sign on March 4 and conjoins Uranus there on the eighth, reminding you that loving yourself means being yourself—no matter what anyone else thinks.

Venus spends an unusually long time in Gemini in this year (April 3-August 7), and her retrograde in that sign (May 13-June 24) gives you an opportunity to reflect on what you love, value, and desire most in life. Don’t be surprised if some of those things have changed!</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Face it, Taurus, you’re evolving. And this year, the effects are rippling out into all areas of your life. It’s exciting, but can also be disorienting—for you and everyone else.

Both inner and outer conflicts arise in the second half of the year, especially while Mars is retrograde in Aries (September 9-November 13). With Mercury in the opposite sign of Libra, it’s tempting to bottle up anger and stress to keep the peace. But you’re much better off channeling them into positive action and creative compromise.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>This energy is likely to play out in family dynamics—especially with your siblings, cousins, or in-laws. With two eclipses in Cancer (lunar January 10, solar June 20) and two major conjunctions in Capricorn (Saturn/Pluto January 12; Jupiter/Pluto April 4, June 29, and November 12), these relationships are up for a massive overhaul in 2020.

Family ties may be forever, Taurus, but they shouldn’t tie you down. As you continue to evolve, your family will be challenged to evolve too—whether they like it or not!</strong></p>
