<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>A friendly sun-Venus conjunction in outgoing Gemini on June 3 gives you the chance to add more important dates to your social calendar. New connections made now might only be temporary (due to Venus being retrograde), but they each serve a very specific and short-term beneficial purpose.

You’re tested during the sun-Mars square on the sixth, but it’s so satisfying to see the looks on your critics’ faces when you pass with flying colors. You might be down for a little while, but you always manage to spring back up eventually, and better than you were before, much to the disappointment of your haters.
A dreaded Mercury retrograde period starts on June 17, so be careful when doing DIY projects around the house. You have some excellent ideas about how to make changes without spending a lot of money, but cutting corners can lead to unforeseen complications.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Relationships get back on track and start moving forward again when Venus goes direct in easygoing Gemini on the twenty-fourth, but you might not be entirely out of the woods just yet. It’s easy to forgive but much harder to forget.

Powerful Mars enters your enthusiastic sign on June 27, so take full advantage of this forceful energy. When you grab the initiative, you show everyone that you aren’t afraid to take on new challenges.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Practical concerns such as childcare, eldercare, and division of household duties carry an extra emotional charge. Watch out for hypersensitivity or nostalgia for the past that could block honest, constructive dialogues from taking place.

After all, Aries, whatever else you’ve got going on, family comes first.</strong></p>
