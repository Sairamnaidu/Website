<img src="gemini.jpg" style="width:14%;height:14%;center">

<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>Geminis are born between May 22 and June 22, and belong to the Air element of the zodiac (along with Libra and Aquarius). Air signs are smart, sharp and speedy; they THINK more than they feel, or do.
Geminis are the liveliest of the Air sign gang - versatile, youthful, curious and fun. They make great company, but they are hard to pin down in any way, so they’re notoriously easier to connect with as friends than partners.
Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury,which makes them fast, witty and super into communications. Words are their weapon of choice.Geminis are not known for being sentimental or emotional, they are the kind of friend who will disappear if you start crying (unless you’re also simultaneously revealing some really juicy gossip). Their leaning on the analytical, mental, cerebral side of life makes it easier for them to disconnect and see situations dispassionately. 
They adore dissecting thorny issues but they’re likely to come up with some pretty, quite frankly, psychopathic-sounding solutions.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Mercury is a planet which is associated with speed, and Geminis think fast, eat fast, move fast, talk fast, “get” stuff fast, change their mind fast… so much so that they can even meet themselves coming back round the other way! This can make them seem erratic, even duplicitous, because they don’t stick to their opinions or commitments.Gemini wants to KNOW IT ALL. And they are particularly turned ALL THE WAY on by salacious, scandalous and sexually-inflammatory gossip and intrigue. They have no problem spreading shit around- surely that’s what everyone is doing anyway,Many people fleetingly fancy the Gemmys because of their youthful, fun, partying exterior… but not THAT many can get past their actual chilly nature and need to be free and untethered. Relationships are sometimes difficult for them.Other Air signs respect that need for space, though, because they feel it too, and are entertaining and clever enough to keep things stimulating. So, Libra, Gemini and Aquarius ALL get on well.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Gemini is in polarity to the mutable fire sign Sagittarius. Ruled by Mercury, Gemini loves to analyze, preferring to focus on gathering small, fascinating details, sometimes using mischief to tease, prod, and disrupt. Sagittarius, however, is ruled by Jupiter and likes to affirm, expand, and explore universal truths.

As a result, Jupiter and its expansive ways are traditionally thought to be in detriment or at a disadvantage when placed opposite from its home in Gemini’s detail-focused world. It’s a placement that the planet of benevolence and belief would have to compensate for to be in, finding creative ways to open big-picture opportunities without getting lost in the minutiae.

This combination could also present Jupiter’s energy of abundance being put into overdrive, by wanting to endlessly collect details and facts, as though there could never be enough. Those born with Jupiter in Gemini may at times feel challenged to hold a perception of multiplicity in balance with a sense of wholeness.</strong></p>
