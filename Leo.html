<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strongWork hard, play harder—Leo, that’s your secret for getting the most out of life. And with Mars burning through your fellow fire signs this year, that famous lust for life is stronger than ever!

Mars kicks off 2020 in free-spirited Sagittarius (January 3-February 16), then spends the second half of the year (starting June 27) in impulsive Aries. You’re eager to get out there, explore uncharted territory, and discover new horizons. Ready or not, world, here you come!</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>
Still, other influences suggest it may be wiser to slow your roll. The south node enters Sagittarius on May 5, making it harder to know when to act and easier to overdo it. If you keep burning the candle at both ends, eventually you could burn yourself out.

Let the June 5 lunar eclipse in Sag be your last hurrah before reining yourself in. A solar eclipse in Cancer follows on June 20, inviting you to turn inward and reconnect with your emotions… and maybe even your higher self. It may not be quite the adventure you had in mind, Leo, but this journey of self-discovery promises to be very exciting!</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Saturn/Pluto (January 12) hits you with a reality check at the beginning of the year. Like it or not, you’re going to have to make some lifestyle changes if you want to keep going strong through 2020 and beyond. But it might take Jupiter/Pluto (April 4, June 29, and November 12) to light enough of a fire under you to make it happen.

Transformation is an intense process, Leo. But you’ve got more than enough energy, enthusiasm, and willpower to see it through—and nothing, not even a Mars retrograde (September 9-November 13) can get in your way!</strong></p>
