<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>The time is now, Sag. With Mars in your sign at the start of 2020 (January 3-February 16), you’re ready to step more fully into your personal power.

But to truly seize the moment, you’ll need to let go of whatever’s weighing you down. The south node enters your sign on May 5, offering major opportunities to clear past karma and break unconscious patterns preventing you from showing up as your best self. Like that old habit of taking yourself too seriously: The north node in your opposite sign, Gemini, teaches you to lighten up, admit your mistakes, and be more open to changing your mind.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Two eclipses in your sign (lunar June 5, solar December 14) also support you in releasing lower-vibe expressions of your sign’s energy and consciously cultivating higher ones such as honesty, generosity, positivity, and broadmindedness.

With your ruling planet Jupiter in Capricorn for most of the year, you’ve got the discipline to apply yourself to this important task. By setting and achieving meaningful goals for your personal growth, you’re also building greater self-esteem, self-worth, and self-love.

Jupiter aligns with Pluto three times this year (April 4, June 29, November 12), bringing you back to basics with renewed enthusiasm for your most essential core values. Empathy, compassion, and altruism are some of your highest ideals—and Jupiter’s sextile with Neptune in Pisces (exact February 20, July 27, and October 12) helps you put them into practice.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>After all, Sag, your actions don’t just affect you—they affect everyone you interact with (and even some you don’t). And when Jupiter enters socially conscious Aquarius in December and makes his Great Conjunction with Saturn on the twenty-first, you’re invited to step up your game and take on a whole new level of responsibility… ready or not!

You can start by taking responsibility for the energy you’re giving out. As disruptive Uranus continues his transit of Taurus, it can be challenging to stay grounded and centered—but it’s more important than ever. Keep showing up for yourself by nurturing body, mind, and spirit. That way, Sag, you’ll be able to keep showing up for others.</strong></p>
