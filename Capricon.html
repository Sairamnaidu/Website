<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>No pressure, Capricorn! But this year, all astrological eyes are on you.

With Saturn, Pluto, and Jupiter all converging in your sign at the start of 2020, you’re definitely in the hot seat. How do you stand it? Ironically, not by “going hard,” but by softening, opening, and accepting. Your opposite sign of Cancer shows you how.Saturn joins Pluto in your sign on January 12, just two days after a Cancer lunar eclipse. You’re faced with the reality that, strong and competent as you are, there’s only so much you can handle or accomplish on your own. How might your life be transformed if you finally accepted your own limitations and let someone else help?</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>Generous Jupiter also aligns with Pluto three times this year, and their second meeting on June 29 falls between a solar eclipse in Cancer (June 20) and a lunar eclipse in your sign (July 4). As you continue your personal metamorphosis, you’re able to find meaning in the difficulties and trust that whatever’s happening is for the highest good.

Through it all, take good care of yourself so body, mind, and spirit can support and sustain you. A sextile between Jupiter in your sign and Neptune in Pisces (February 20, July 27, and October 12) helps you channel your impressive self-discipline into treating yourself—and others—with greater compassion.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>This will serve you well in the later part of the year, when Mars in Aries squares Jupiter (August 4, October 18), Pluto (August 13, October 9, December 23), and Saturn (August 24, September 29) in your sign. Things at home can get a little tense, with conflicts arising over domestic duties, caregiving responsibilities, or even holiday plans. Take a breath and remind yourself: You’re all in this together.

After all, Capricorn, with Saturn dividing his time this year between your sign and Aquarius (your house of self-worth and values), it’s time to focus on what really matters. Saturn’s Great Conjunction with Jupiter in Aquarius on December 21 begins a new 20-year cycle, so you’ll want to start it off on the right foot!</strong></p>
