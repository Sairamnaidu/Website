<img src="libra.jpg" style="width:14%;height:14%;center">

<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px";><strong>Libra, you’re everyone’s favorite social butterfly. But as 2020 begins, you may find yourself retreating back into the cocoon.

As January 10’s lunar eclipse in Cancer urges you to shed your protective shell and January 12’s Saturn/Pluto conjunction in Capricorn initiates an inner metamorphosis, it’s only natural to prefer the privacy of your own home. You’ll need a safe space in which to process your emotions—with Jupiter conjoining Pluto three times this year (April 4, June 29, and November 12), there’ll be a lot coming to the surface.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>You tend to be on the more reserved side when it comes to expressing your feelings, and when you want to minimize drama, that’s just good sense. Still, with Jupiter and Pluto opening the floodgates, your true feelings are coming out… ready or not! The summer eclipse season, with lunar eclipses in Sagittarius on June 5 and Capricorn on July 4, is all about getting things off your chest—especially if they’re family-related.

If all this seems heavy, Libra, have no fear. Your ruling planet Venus balances the scales by spending extra time in easy, breezy Gemini (April 3-August 7, retrograde May 12-June 24). After starting the year in homebody mode, this transit draws you back out into the wider world. Plan a faraway trip, sample the sights and sounds of a different culture, or begin a new field of study—anything that captures your imagination and expands your sense of possibility.</strong></p>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:20px"><strong>These explorations could be just for fun… or they could get your life moving in a whole new direction. It may not be clear until after the Cancer solar eclipse on June 20, but one thing’s for sure: New avenues of self-expression and personal achievement are opening for you.

The “new you” begins to emerge as Mercury, the sun, and Venus transit your sign (September-November). You may get pushback from those who know and love the “old you,” especially November 9-19 when Venus opposes Mars in Aries and squares Pluto, Jupiter, and Saturn in Capricorn. But don’t worry, Libra, they’ll learn to love it as much as you do!</strong></p>
